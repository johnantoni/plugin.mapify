mapping methods and helpers
   
	distance_between
    	given two lat/lon points, compute the distance between the two points using the haversine formula
    	the result will be a Hash of distances which are key'd by :mi, :km, :ft, and :m

	radius_around_point
		given a single point (lat,lng) and a radius (distance) calculates box area around point
